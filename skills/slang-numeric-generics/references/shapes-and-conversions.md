# Shapes, Masks, and Numeric Conversions

## Same-shaped masks

Comparison on a shaped type returns `T.Mask`, not necessarily `bool`:

```slang
T.Mask componentLess<T : IComponentwiseOrdered>(T left, T right)
{
    return left < right;
}

bool allLess<T : IComponentwiseOrdered>(T left, T right)
{
    return all(left < right);
}
```

Preserve component-wise semantics.
Reduce with `all` or `any` only when the source algorithm requires one Boolean result.

## Scalar-to-shaped values

A same-type operator does not automatically accept a distinct scalar operand.
Use `T.fromScalar` when the source semantics require splatting one scalar over the logical shape:

```slang
T weightedSum<T : IFractional>(T left, T right, T.Scalar weight)
{
    T shapedWeight = T.fromScalar(weight);
    return left * (T.one() - shapedWeight) + right * shapedWeight;
}
```

## Construction from builtin values

`INumeric` includes construction from every builtin integer type.
`IFractional` additionally includes construction from every builtin floating-point type.
Use ordinary construction syntax in generic code:

```slang
T addBuiltinFloat<T : IFractional, S : __BuiltinFloatingPointType>(T left, S right)
{
    return left + T(right);
}
```

The sealed constraint is appropriate for the generic source because the conversion facility explicitly promises builtin source types.
The destination remains constrained by its public mathematical capability.

For component-wise conversion, construct every destination component from its corresponding source component.
Do not convert one component and splat it.
See the compiler-checked [conversion example](examples/builtin-numeric-conversion.slang).
